Your agents are powered by advanced AI language models (LLMs), which act as the “brain” behind the scenes. You can configure these models to control how your agents behave.

### Model Options

Each model tier offers a different balance of speed, cost, and intelligence:

* **Express** – Lightweight and fast. Ideal for simple tasks and quick replies.
* **Core** *(default)* – A balanced choice. Handles most customer interactions well.
* **Ultra** – The most advanced. Excels at understanding complex requests and reasoning step-by-step, though slightly slower.

> **Tip:**
> Start with **Express** to keep your agents fast and cost-efficient. If you notice performance issues or more complex needs, upgrade to **Core** or **Ultra**.
> For critical tasks, we recommend using **Ultra**.

### Additional Settings

* **Tool Choice** – Controls how the agent uses tools:

  * `"auto"` *(default)*: Model decides when to use tools
  * `"required"`: Tools must always be used
  * `"none"`: Tool usage is disabled
* **Parallel Tool Calls** – Enables calling multiple tools at once.

  * `true` or `false` *(default: false)*

<Aside type="caution">
   Advanced settings come with safe defaults. Changing them without understanding their effect may lead to unexpected behavior. Only modify these if you're confident in what they do.
