Agents are the main building‑block of a multi-agent system. Each agent is a proxy for an LLM. 
Each agent has a set of tools and context. Each agent can use these tools and context to complete its task.
In short, LLM is the brain of the agent, tools are the hands and context is the eyes.

- **Name** – the name of the agent.
- **Instructions** – the system prompt that tells the agent _who it is_ and _how it should respond_.
- **Model** – determines how intelligent the agent is. The more intelligent the model, the more complex the agent can be. However, the more complex the agent, the more expensive it is to run in time and money.
- **Tools** – a list of functions or APIs the model can invoke to accomplish a task. Depending on the type of the MAS, lookfor provides a set of useful tools for you to equip an agent of the MAS.

## Context

Agents are equipped with a set of context. Context is a set of variables that are available to the agent. 
The context is different for each type of the MAS. For example storefront MAS has `customer.isLoggedIn` variable but an email MAS doesn't have it becuase being logged in is not a concept in email.
You can find the list of the context variables for each type of the MAS [here](https://lookfor.ai/docs/guides/context).
You can also use the context variables in the [instructions](#instructions).

## Handoffs

An Agent can **delegate** to other Agents. You select which agent an agent can delegate to when you create the agent.
Back of the scene, a handoff is actually a tool that an agent can use to delegate to other agents.
A common pattern is to use a _triage agent_ that routes the conversation to a more specialised sub‑agent.
However, there are many more patterns you can use. See the [handoffs](/openai-agents-js/guides/handoffs) guide for more details.

## Instructions

Instructions are the system prompt that tells the agent _who it is_ and _how it should respond_. 
Depending of the type of the multi-agent system, we provide a set of variables that you can use in the instructions. 
As an example, for a storefront MAS, we provide the following variables:
- `customer.isLoggedIn` – whether the customer is logged in. 
- `customer.name` – the name of the customer.

You can say in the instructions that if `customer.isLoggedIn` is true, you should say "Hello `customer.name`".

See the [instructions](/openai-agents-js/guides/instructions) guide to learn how to write good instructions.

> The task of writing instructions for LLMs are called **prompt engineering**. 
> It is a complex topic and there are many resources available online but in the end it is trial and error.
> You should try different instructions and see what works best for your use case. 
> It is obvious that LLMs will be an important part of our lives and basically everyone will be a prompt engineer.
> Think of it like **searching the web**, ones who used search engines efficiently in the last 20 years created many opportunities, it will be the case for LLMs. 
> There is no better time than now to learn prompt engineering. If you have any questions, please reach out to us. We can guide you.

## Model

An Agent is a proxy for an LLM. The model determines how intelligent the agent is. 
The more intelligent the model, the more complex the agent can be. However, the more complex the agent, 
the more expensive it is to run in time and money. There are three different models available for an agent:
 - Express – fastest response time, lowest quality (can be used for simple tasks or triage agents)
 - Core – the default model. It is a good choice for most tasks. Balanced quality and response time. 
 - Ultra – the slowest response time, highest quality. This model is different than express or core because it does reasoning by thinking step by step.
 It should only be used for complex tasks or agents that need to be very accurate because it may take longer to respond which causes the entire MAS to slow down.
 
See the [models](/openai-agents-js/guides/models) guide to learn more about models.

## Tools

You can supply tools to an agent. Tools are functions or APIs that the agent can invoke to accomplish a task. 
There are many built-in tools available for agents. The available tools are different for each type of the MAS.
You can find the list of the tools for each type of the MAS [here](https://lookfor.ai/docs/guides/tools).
You can also [create your own API tools](/openai-agents-js/guides/tools) or [propose new tools to us](https://tally.so/r/3jqB41).

## Forcing tool use

Supplying tools doesn’t guarantee the agent will use one. You can **force** tool use with
`Tool Choice` setting in the advanced settings of the agent configuration:

1. `'auto'` (default) – the agent decides whether to use a tool.
2. `'required'` – the agent _must_ call a tool (it can choose which one). If you remember every handoff is a tool, you can use this setting to force the agent to delegate to another agent.
3. `'none'` – the agent must **not** call a tool.
