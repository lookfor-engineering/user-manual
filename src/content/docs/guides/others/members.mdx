Human agents are the staff members of your store. 
Due to the limitations in Shopify's API, staff members in your Shopfy store should login to lookfor app with their own account to be listed
as a member in the dashboard. You can see the list of members in the **Settings/Organization/Members** page.
Also if someone leaves your store in Shopify, they are not automatically removed from the list but organization owner can remove them manually.
