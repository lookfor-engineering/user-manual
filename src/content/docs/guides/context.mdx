Agents are equipped with a set of context. Context is a set of variables that are available to the agent. 
The context is different for each type of the MAS. For example storefront MAS has `customer.isLoggedIn` variable but an email MAS doesn't have it becuase being logged in is not a concept in email.
Every agent in a MAS has the same context provided while running, so they aware of them out of the box. 
However, you can refer to the context variables in the [instructions](/guides/prompt-engineering#personalizing-responses-with-context-variables) to achieve something specific.

## Context Variables
The context variables are different for each type of the MAS. See the list of the context variables for each type:

- **[Storefront MAS Context](/guides/storefront-mas#context-variables)**
- **[Email MAS Context](/guides/email-mas#context-variables)**
