## How to get started

<Steps>

1. Check [plans](https://lookfor.ai/pricing) and pick the correct plan for your store. 
2. Install [lookfor: AI Agents & AI Chatbot](https://apps.shopify.com/lookfor-ai-shopping-assistant) app to your Shopify store with 14 days free trial. 
3. Login to [dashboard.lookfor.ai](https://dashboard.lookfor.ai). We start syncing your store data to our system when you first logged in. It usually takes 5-30 mins depending on the size of your store. Wait until you receive "You store is synced successfully" email in your store's email.

## Create your first agent

There are many types of multi-agent systems. Each type of a MAS has different set of tools and context.
Storefront MAS is the most common one. Storefront MAS can be assigned to the storefront channel and it will respond to customer queries coming from lookfor Chatbot.

1. Create your first storefront multi-agent system on [MAS editor](https://dashboard.lookfor.ai/app/multi-agent-systems). Guide to create a storefront MAS is [here](https://lookfor.ai/docs/guides/multi-agent-systems). 
2. Assign it to your [storefront channel](https://lookfor.ai/docs/guides/channels). 
3. Open [Shopify Theme Editor](https://demolookfor.myshopify.com/admin/themes/current/editor?context=apps&amp;appEmbed=42f146aa-ed1e-41f4-8990-543d1ca2f633/counter), customize and activate lookfor Chatbot to your storefront. 
4. Go to your storefront and start chatting with lookfor Chatbot.
