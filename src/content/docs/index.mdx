lookfor.ai enables you to build [multi-agent systems (MASs)](/guides/multi-agent-systems) that work 24/7 for your Shopify store. 
Multi-agent systems are able to perform many tasks that a human staff would do. 
This means you can save time and money by automating your store. 
We already prepared the ground for you, you just need to set up the MASs using our app. 

## Why use the lookfor.ai

The lookfor.ai has four driving principles:

1. Set/catch the state of the art. We want to be the best in the world at what we do. You will see how fast our tool is adapting to the rapidly changing AI landscape. 
2. Success is in the details. lookfor.ai has a plenty of small details that make a big difference. 
3. Powerful but easy to use. Learning a tool shouldn't be more complex than problems it solve. 
4. If it works, it works. We want to make sure you are happy with the lookfor.ai. If somehow you are not happy, we will fix it. 

Here are the main features of the lookfor.ai:

- **Multi-agent systems**: Create multi-agent systems by designing `agents` with powerful `tools` and `context` to automate your store.
You basically just need to describe what you want them to do in your natural language and they will do. 
A multi-agent system can do: 
   - **Respond to customer queries in Storefront/Email/WhatsApp**
   - **Create blog posts that enhances your GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)**
- **Knowledge base**: Your products, collections, orders, customers, etc. are always up to date with your store. Multi-agent systems can use this knowledge base to complete their tasks. 
For example, storefront MAS can use this knowledge base to answer customer queries or a content MAS can use this knowledge base to create blog posts. 
- **Inbox**: All conversations from `Storefront`/`Email`/`WhatsApp` are in one place. 
It doesn't only shows you the conversation, it also shows you the context of the conversation and customer's information. 

## Sounds cool BUT isn't it simply a chatbot?
Yes and no. Let me explain it to you clearly. [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) are machine learning models that are designed to understand and generate human language. 
The concept of LLMs goes back to 90s but the recent breakthroughs in the field of LLMs have made them more powerful and versatile. 
Chatbot developers saw the potential and started building chatbots using LLMs. From a technical perspective, a chatbot is a proxy for an LLM. It takes a user's input, adds some context, sends it to an LLM, and displays the output.
The concept is cool but its capabilities are limited. It cannot take actions, almost only words. In short, chatbots also use LLMs but as a text answer generator. 

A multi-agent system is a more powerful tool. It is the state of the art concept in the field of using LLMs as a unit of intelligence. Rather than using LLMs as a text answer generator, it uses LLMs as a unit of intelligence. 
It is a system that consists of multiple agents. Each agent is a proxy for an LLM. Each agent has a set of tools and context. Each agent can use these tools and context to complete its task.
In short, LLM is the brain of the agent, tools are the hands and context is the eyes. MAS is a team of agents that can work together to complete a task.
